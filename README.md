# Merit System

## Overview

MeritSystem is an open-source project that aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by modern network infrastructure. It utilizes a merit-based consensus algorithm and focuses on building a highly available, decentralized infrastructure based on user authentication and device performance. This project offers a novel approach to address infrastructure issues and enhance network reliability.

For detailed information, please visit our [project's Wiki](https://github.com/elysia090/Merit-System/wiki).

## Key Features

- **Merit-Based Consensus Algorithm:** MeritSystem implements a unique consensus algorithm called "Proof of Merit" (SegAS-DPDoC) that rewards users based on their contributions to the network.

- **User Authentication:** It provides robust user authentication and device performance-based trust mechanisms, ensuring high levels of security and reliability.

- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** The project's primary goal is to create a decentralized infrastructure that is accessible and usable by individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises.

- **Open Source:** MeritSystem is open-source and available on GitHub, fostering a collaborative community for development and innovation.
